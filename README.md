# Insider Client

React front end application that renders data and visualizations from API's JSON responses.  API repo can be found [here](https://www.github.com/everysum1/insiderAPI), which requests insider transactions from SEC servers, scrapes FTP servers for corresponding XML files, parses files into database objects using [Nokogiri](https://www.nokogiri.org), and serves up JSON-formatted information. You can find live version [here] (https://yourinsider.herokuapp.com).
